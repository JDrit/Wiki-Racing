Wiki-Racing
===========
This project's goal is to be able to find the best path between any two 
wikipedia articles.

Dependicies:
- python2 (v2.7.3):
	The program usesw cPickle, an C implementation of Pickle, which is not supported in
	python3.
- Bottle (v0.12-dev):
	It is a lightweight (single file), fast, WSGI web framework that runs completly in
	python. Bottle has support for templates, routing, and multiple different types of 
	servers. It defaultly uses wsgiref WSGIServer, a non-threading HTTP server, which can
	cause the server to be slow. It handles all the request that the server gets and 
	calls all the important	methods when needed.
- Paste (v1.7.5.1):
	This is not required but it fixes the problem of the server not being able to handle
	multiple request at the same time. This is the suggested server to run instead of the
	default but, others could be cherrypy, rocket, waitress, etc. 

Files:
- parser.py:
	Reads the .xml file from wikipedia and pulls out the article title and all
	the links in it. It saves each (title, link) pair as a list using
	cPickle.

- pathFinder.py:
	Holds the methods used by the server to load the articles into memory and find
	the best path between any two articles. The data for each class is stored in
	a python dictionary with the key being the article name and the value being a
	string of all the links that the article has. The pathfinder method has instance
	list for distances and parents of each article so that mult. connections
	do not interfer with each other.	

- server.py:
	Uses the bottle python web server framework to handle requests. The main path is
	'/path' but everything gets redirected to /path as well. The server handles 404 and
	500 errors. It uses a templates system to help display the path to the user. It imports
	the methods from pathFinder.py.

- pathViewer.tpl:
	The template file used for the bottle server. It displays the result from the give input
	in a list.

- index.tpl:
	The template for the start page as long as the error message page.
