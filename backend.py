description: This runs in the background, finding paths that could not be found
    the webserver. When a path is not found, it is added to the fail database
    and than read into a worker thread that gives it a longer time to find the
    path. Once a path is found it is added to the database. If there are no
    failed paths, then the program picks a common start and end article and
    finds the path between them.
